# My dotfiles

I'm using GNU Stow to manage my configuration for now.

See `bootstrap.sh` to see how stow works in this context.

## Notes for self:

Things that just dotfiles will miss out:

1. [scripts repo](https://github.captnemo.in/scripts)
1. `~/bin` directory, which I don't version control.
1. Wallpapers
1. nvm
1. rvm
1. npm preinstalled packages
